# PantryPad

## A pantry inventory and management system

### Installation instructions
Coming soon...

### Build/Develop
1. All the source is in the PantryPad subfolder, so `cd PantryPad` to start
2. To work on the backend, simply run `dotnet watch` and start coding.
3. To work on the frontend, sim do an additional `cd wwwroot` and run `npm install` (if you did not already), followed by `npm run start`
4. If you need to work on both, you can run each command in a separate terminal.

I would like to create a devcontainer soon to make this easier... Coming soon...
